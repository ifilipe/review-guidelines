Attempt at collecting universally applicable review practices to the benefit of product and engineering teams and communities.

## What makes a good review?

In most circumstances:

 - Timeliness
 - Conciseness
 - Constructiveness

 - Completeness
 
 In some circumstances:
 - Real-timeness

### Constructiveness

Constructive feedback should be encouraging, valuable, practical.
 
#### Why it is important?
Regardless of the nature of the work in review (e.g: product feature, linux kernel) and context (startup, corp, open source community) if/when one is looking for a review of work odds are that person/group is not working in isolation and the review is part of a collaboration effort. Depending on the incentives at stake and the people involved, it's not impossible a non-constructive review contribution will still produce results considered good for the involved parties. More often than not though, that won't be the case.

Reasons that might lead one to want keep their review contributions purely constructive:
 - it generally drives more fluid collaboration flows
 - it makes people receiving the review feedback more engaged and willing to listen to one's ideas
 - it can help build rapport and trust with co-reviewers and author(s) of the work in review

#### When it is relevant
Constructive reviews are particularly important when:
 - one intends to suggest (substantial) changes to the proposed work
 - one's reviewing work authored by people you're likely work again in the future
 - one's reviewing work authored by people who they want to have an harmonious relationship with

#### Examples
Awful: `This is wrong`
Bad: `This addition is wrong because it will introduce a security vulnerability`
Good: `Have you considered security implications of this addition? It will make the system vulnerable to SQL injection. In order to avoid that, the input data should be sanitised. Here's an example: <link to example>`
